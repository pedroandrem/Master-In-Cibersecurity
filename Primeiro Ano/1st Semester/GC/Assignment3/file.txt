Hacker gain access to Target's system by stealing credentials 
provided by a contractor that ran Target' climate systems.
This happened because Target failed to segment its network to ensure
that Fazio didn't have access to its payment systems. 

Hackers exploited this connection, uploading malware onto Target's 
systmes, including its POS (point-of-sale).

POS system includes software and hardware:
 - Hardware inlcudes cash register, credit cards reader or terminal,
 pad, and monitor.
 - Software communicates the customer's information using a central 
 payment-processing server connected to a number of POS application
 terminals.

 The malware used by the hackers, was stealing customer's data at the 
 POS. Basically, its callled "RAM scrappers" cause it copies customer's
 card info while it was still in the memory storage of 
 POS system (aka Payment terminals).

When a card is used in a POS his credentials are stored in RAM and
because this malware was in the POS systems it would copy this data
before it was encrypted.
