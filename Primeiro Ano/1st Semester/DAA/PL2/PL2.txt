# Machine Learning Algorithm (Decision Trees)

Decision Tree (DT)
    Is a model that predicts the value of a target feature:
    - It is a hierarchical graph (tree)
    - Each branch represents a selection from a set of alternatives
    - Each leaf node represents a class 

    DT Classifier is used for classification problems, where the target feature is class: 
    - Have lunch is a binary classification problem: yes or no 
    - Whether or not someone survived the Titanic is another binary classification problem: 1 or 0 
    - Classifying a set of images of fruits is a multiclass classification problem: oranges, apples or pears 

    DT Regressor is used for regression problems, where the target feature is a real or continuous value: 
    - Predicting the traffic flow in km/h
    - Predicting sotck prices in €

# Classification Models: Confusion matrix
    A confusion matrix is a table that is used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data which
    the true values are known
        Example of Matrix: 
                                    True class
                            |----------------------------------|
                            |   True Positive | False Positive |
         Predictive Class   |                 |                |
                            |----------------------------------|            
                            | False Negative  | True Negative  |
                            |                 |                |
                            |----------------------------------|
        
        - Accuracy is defined as the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of observations
        - Precision is a measure of exactness and determines the proportion of relevant items among those retrieved
        - Recall is a measure of completeness and determines the fraction of relevant items obtained
